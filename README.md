## Description

`TGF` is a small utility used to launch a Docker image and automatically map the current folder, your HOME folder and your current environment
variables to the underlying container.

By default, TGF is used as a frontend for [terragrunt](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt), but it could also be used to run different endpoints.

### Why use TGF

Using `TGF` ensure that all your users are using the same set of tools to run infrastructure configuration even if they are working on different environments (`linux`, `Microsoft Windows`, `Mac OSX`, etc).

`Terraform` is very sensitive to the version used and if one user update to a newer version, the state files will be marked with the latest version and
all other user will have to update their `Terraform` version to the latest used one.

Also, tools such as `AWS CLI` are updated on a regular basis and people don't tend to update their version regularly, resulting in many different version
among your users. If someone make a script calling a new feature of the `AWS` api, that script may break when executed by another user that has an
outdated version.

## Installation

On `mac` and `linux`:  

You can run the `get-latest-tgf.sh` script to check if you have the latest version of tgf installed and install it if needed:

```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coveooss/tgf/master/get-latest-tgf.sh | bash
```

On `Windows`, run `get-latest-tgf.ps1` with Powershell:

```PowerShell
(Invoke-WebRequest https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coveooss/tgf/master/get-latest-tgf.ps1).Content | Invoke-Expression
```

>  This will install tgf in your current directory. Make sure to add the executable to your PATH.

## Configuration

TGF has multiple levels of configuration. It first looks through the [AWS parameter store](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/systems-manager/parameter-store/)
under `/default/tgf` using your current [AWS CLI configuration](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-started.html) if any. There it tries to find parameters called `config-location` (example: bucket.s3.amazonaws.com/foo) and `config-paths` (example: my-file.json:my-second-file.json, default: TGFConfig). If it finds `config-location`, it fetches its config from that path using the [go-getter library](https://github.com/hashicorp/go-getter). Otherwise, it looks directly in SSM for configuration keys (ex: `/default/tgf/logging-level`).

TGF then looks for a file named .tgf.config or tgf.user.config in the current working folder (and recursively in any parent folders) to get its parameters. These configuration files overwrite the remote configurations.
Your configuration file could be expressed in  [YAML](http://www.yaml.org/start.html) or [JSON](http://www.json.org/)

Example of YAML configuration file:

```yaml
docker-refresh: 1h
logging-level: notice
```

Example of JSON configuration file:

```json
{
  "docker-refresh": "1h",
  "logging-level": "notice"
}
```

### Configuration section

It is possible to specify configuration elements that only apply on specific os.

Example of HCL configuration file:

```text
docker-refresh: 1h
logging-level: notice
windows:
  logging-level: debug
linux:
  docker-refresh: 2h
```

section | Description
--- | ---
| windows | Configuration that is applied only on Windows systems
| linux | Configuration that is applied only on Linux systems
| darwin | Configuration that is applied only on OSX systems
| ix | Configuration that is applied only on Linux or OSX systems

## TGF Invocation

```text
> tgf -H
usage: tgf [<flags>]

DESCRIPTION: TGF (terragrunt frontend) is a Docker frontend for terragrunt/terraform. It automatically maps your current
folder, your HOME folder, your TEMP folder as well of most environment variables to the docker process. You can add -D to your command to get the
exact docker command that is generated.

It then looks in your current folder and all its parents to find a file named '.tgf.config' to retrieve the default configuration. If not all
configurable values are satisfied and you have an AWS configuration, it will then try to retrieve the missing elements from the AWS Parameter Store
under the key '/default/tgf'.

Configurable values are: docker-image, docker-image-version, docker-image-tag, docker-image-build, docker-image-build-folder,
docker-image-build-tag, logging-level, entry-point, docker-refresh, docker-options, recommended-image-version, required-image-version,
tgf-recommended-version, environment, run-before, run-after, alias.

You can get the full documentation at https://github.com/coveooss/tgf/blob/master/README.md and check for new version at
https://github.com/coveooss/tgf/releases/latest.

Any docker image could be used, but TGF specialized images could be found at: https://hub.docker.com/r/coveo/tgf/tags.

Terragrunt documentation could be found at https://github.com/coveo/terragrunt/blob/master/README.md (Coveo fork)

Terraform documentation could be found at https://www.terraform.io/docs/index.html.

IMPORTANT: Most of the tgf command line arguments are in uppercase to avoid potential conflict with the underlying command. If any of the tgf
arguments conflicts with an argument of the desired entry point, you must place that argument after -- to ensure that they are not interpreted by
tgf and are passed to the entry point. Any non conflicting argument will be passed to the entry point wherever it is located on the invocation
arguments.

  tgf ls -- -D   # Avoid -D to be interpreted by tgf as --debug

It is also possible to specify additional arguments through environment variable TGF_ARGS or enable debugging mode through TGF_DEBUG.

## Usage

### As Terragrunt front-end

```bash
> tgf plan
```

Invoke `terragrunt plan` (which will invoke `terraform plan`) after doing the `terragrunt` relative configurations.

```bash
> tgf apply -var env=dev
```

Invoke `terragrunt apply` (which will invoke `terraform apply`) after doing the `terragrunt` relative configurations. You can pass any arguments
that are supported by `terraform`.

```bash
> tgf plan-all
```

Invoke `terragrunt plan-all` (which will invoke `terraform plan` on the current folder and all sub folders). `Terragrunt` allows xxx-all operations to be
executed according to dependencies that are defined by the [dependencies statements](https://github.com/coveo/terragrunt#dependencies-between-modules).

### Other usages

```bash
> tgf -e aws s3 ls
```

Invoke `AWS CLI` as entry point and list all s3 buckets

```bash
> tgf -e fish
```

Start a shell `fish` in the current folder

```bash
> tgf -e my_command -i my_image:latest
```

Invokes `my_command` in your own docker image. As you can see, you can do whatever you need to with `tgf`. It is not restricted to only the pre-packaged
Docker images, you can use it to run any program in any Docker images. Your imagination is your limit.

## Development

Build are automatically launched on tagging.

Tags with format image-0.0.0 automatically launch a Docker images build that are available through Docker Hub.
Tags with format v0.0.0 automatically launch a new release on Github for the TGF executable.
